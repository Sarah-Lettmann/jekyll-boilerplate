# jekyll-boilerplate
A boilerplate for jekyll sites so I don't have to do the same things over and over again.

## Directories
The boilerplate contains all directories someone could possibly need. If not needed, they can be deleted or left empty.
- data
- drafts
- includes
- layouts
- posts
- pages
- sass
- css
- js
- fonts
- webfonts
- assets

## Example Files
I packed some example files with generic implementation that are needed for almost every website. Files can be adopted if necessary.
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml
- feed.xml
- favicon.ico

## Example Content
- example layouts for post pages and the home page
- all meta tags needed for SEO are integrated
- example page
- example blog post with all tags so you can go into styling and test things immediately.

## Support for ITSCSS
I always work with ITSCSS so I wanted to have the structure saved with examples. This way I can simply put my code in without creating files and folders over and over again. Includes are also already made for all of the files in the styles.scss file.
- folder and file structure
- files contain examples for common tags or classes
- /css/styles.scss with includes of generic scss files
